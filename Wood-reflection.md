*	What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Prior to the GPS session I was having a difficult time understanding how to use the GitHub page, specifically the merging of different branches in a repository.

*	What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

During the session I learned how to properly merge branches using the interface. I also learned how to create new branches in the GitHub repository from the local interface, which is something that I was not aware that I could do at the start of the session.

*	What questions did you ask your pair and guide?

Most of the questions I asked my guide related to the use of the various interfaces, like bash commands or the GitHub webpage. She did an excellent job of leading me to the answers without explicitly telling me what to do.

*	What still confuses you about Git?

Working with other people through GitHub still confuses me. I did not have a partner in this GPS session and thus do not have any experience making my repository available for someone else to use. Hopefully this will all get worked out when I do my pair coding sessions later on in the week.

*	How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I think that overall the experience went pretty well. My guide was able to clear up most of my uncertainties working with Git. I can tell that these sessions will be very useful as I progress through the program.
